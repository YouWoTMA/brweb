      description: >
        As a Mozilla Hispano Labs member (and eventually coordinator) I developed and assisted developing
        innovating tools to make the web a better place for everyone. Working in open source projects allowed
        me to gain a lot of experience before finishing high school, and to work with —and learn from— highly
        talented persons.

      description: >
          With immunity zone, me and my team pushed the boundaries of the web as a platform by implementing
          a fully-featured browser that runs in the cloud. The backend loads the page and executes the
          JavaScript on it, sending the result to the client. The result is a secure, private and faster
          browser that can run inside any modern browser.
